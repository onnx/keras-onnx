# Introduction 
The original Keras project of Masked RCNN is: <https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN>. Follow the 'Installation' section in README.md to set up the model. There is also a good [tutorial](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN#step-by-step-detection) to learn about the object detection.

Currently, conversion code for this model is not ready to be checked in.
